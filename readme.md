**The bootloader used is from this repository:**

[https://github.com/majbthrd/PIC16F1-USB-DFU-Bootloader](https://github.com/majbthrd/PIC16F1-USB-DFU-Bootloader)

I modified it slightly to use C4 as the enter bootloader button in order to keep A3 as the reset button.  I kept the VID/PID the same.  The modified hex can be found in the &quot;firmware&quot; folder. It will work for any 16F145x or LF variant.

Drivers and DFU utilities are included in **Great Cow BASIC** so it is not included here. Or you can use the drivers in the USB-DFU GitHub link.
